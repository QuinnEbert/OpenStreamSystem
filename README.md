OpenStreamSystem
================

Flexible system for online stream site hosting, based on open source technology; intended to be (relatively) easy to install, configure, and begin using.

**Disclaimer:** any resemblence that OpenStreamSystem has to any project I have produced or may produce for any client is purely coincidental; all code used in OpenStreamSystem is completely unique to OpenStreamSystem, and has not originated from any client commissioned work (nor shall any future client-commissioned work incorporate any portion of code from OpenStreamSystem unless specifically requested by the client).

Support Services
----------------

**Available by:** September 2015

*Keep an eye on this space.*  Once OpenStreamSystem has matured sufficiently, I will offer (for a fee) professional self-hosted installation, managed hosting, customization and support services for OpenStreamSystem.

Near-term Goals
---------------
+ Avoid use of Adobe Flash whenever possible
+ Use HTML 5 media-related elements wherever possible
+ Ensure iOS (and, where possible, Android) devices can consume video passed through the system
+ Present scalable client experiences that optimize UX dynamically for both small-format and large-format devices
+ Support popular streaming software, most notably including OBS Multiplatform
+ Automatic archiving of live streams
+ Listing and VOD playback of live stream archives

Long-term Goals
---------------
+ Add system to allow for storing information about archived streams
+ Add support for two-way audiovisual communication sessions (in a non-chatroulette way)
+ Attempt to produce stream-sending clients for iOS and Android devices
